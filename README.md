A fun memory game where players have to remember a growing sequence of blinking lights that the game produces. 
Its time a player accuratly repeats the sequence, a new color is added to the sequence, making it harder as each round is completer. 
The goal is to see, how long a sequence the player can remember correctly. 

**Game Setup:** The game board features 4 colors: red, blue, green, and yellow.

**Starting the Game:** Press the "start" button to begin. The game will display a sequence of colors by lighting them up on the board.

**Remember the Sequence:** Memorize the sequence of colors shown on the board.

**Repeating the Sequence:** When the "GO" button lights up, it's your turn to repeat the sequence. Press the colors in the same order you saw them.

**Strict mode:** If you want to increase difficulty, enable STRICT, this will end the game if you make an error 
If STRICT mode is not enabled, you will see a "NO" in the count display, and the sequence will run again, giving you another try


**Advancing Difficulty:** If you accurately repeat the sequence, the game will add another color to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging.

**Continuing the Game:** The "GO" button will light up again, signaling you to repeat the extended sequence. Keep repeating and adding colors as you succeed.

**Game Objective:** The goal is to see how long you can keep accurately repeating the sequence as it grows longer with each round. Test the limits of your memory and challenge yourself to achieve higher scores!

**WINNER**: You win the game by completing 20 rounds

The game is based on a boardgame created af Ralph H. Baer og Howard J. Morrison in 1978.
